# Exploring AngularJS2

# Instructions

1. Run the following to install the project dependencies:

    `npm install`
    
2. Run the npm start command to build the code, watch for file changes, and serve up the site locally:

    `npm start`


Note that the site will run using `lite-server` and will be served up at the following local address:  
    http://localhost:3000

*If you use a code editor that launches its own web server please note that it may run on a different port number. 
You will want to use `npm start` for this project.*
